<div class="post-content">
<p>Academic knowledge shouldn’t be acquired because we want to gain employment. Rather it should be acquired because we want to refine our crude knowledge-base.</p>

<p>Most times, students study to pass examinations, they engage in cramming and pouring same out at the exam hall just to make high grades in order to get the certificate afterwards. Then, after graduation, they hit the street for job search. This shouldn’t be!</p>

<p>People get employed even without formal education. People still put food on their table without basic education. So, the question is, do we get education just to get jobs? The answer is a big NO!</p>

<p>This traditional ideology of getting admission and doing all it takes even by exam malpractice to pass exams should be erased completely from our subconscious.</p>

<p>Why do nations kill themselves because of crude oil? The answer is simply because of its different values in its refined state. The worth of crude oil is based on its by-products in their refined state. Same implies to gold.</p>

<p>As humans and students, how do we refine ourselves and to what extent do we want to be refined?</p>

<p>Your worth as a student, a teacher, a doctor, a lawyer or whatever course you want to chart for yourself depends on how you refined yourself and to what extent.</p>

<p>If we put this in our subconscious and play by its principles, then, as students, we would study to be refined, we would want to come out the best refined student and because you were the sole manager of the refinery that refined you and haven known the quality of raw materials you were made of, you would definitely know your worth and your selling point.</p>

<p>Today in our society, there are leaders who are managing different positions but are not able to deliver. These positions occupied by these leaders are jobs. Meaning this leader are employed to carry out certain functions either as Managers, governors, councillors, president, HODs, etc but the question is, Are they refined or Are they operating in their crude state? I believe you know the answer already.</p>

<p>When you operate in your crude state without being refined, you will always end up “begging to apply”, or “I humbly anticipate your response”.</p>

<p>When we are refined as humans through quality and research-based education, we would be an authority in our fields.</p>

<p>Applicants panic on days of interview. Why does this happen? The answer is simple. You came in your crude state! When you go refined, you might even end up interviewing the interviewer.</p>

<p>What differentiates a refined applicant from a crude-state applicant is that the former is motivated by his passion and confidence in what he knows how to do best while the later is just after the salary and they would end up accepting whatever is offered to them.</p>

<p>Keep learning; engage in research-based learning to refine yourself. Employers shouldn’t be the one to place value on you. Know your worth by knowing how refined you are!</p>
